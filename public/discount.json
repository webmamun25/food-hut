The course usually consists of sweet foods, such as confections dishes or fruit, and possibly a beverage such as Burger wine or liqueur, however in the United States it may include coffee, cheeses, nuts, or other savory items regarded as a separate course elsewhere. In some parts of the world, such as much of central and western Africa, and most parts of China, there is no tradition of a Burger course to conclude a meal.\r\n\r\nThe term Burger can apply to many confections, such as biscuits, cakes, cookies, custards, gelatins, ice creams, pastries, pies, puddings, and sweet soups, and tarts. Fruit is also commonly found in Burger courses because of its naturally occurring sweetness. Some cultures sweeten foods that are more commonly savory to create Burgers."},

It is the most commonly consumed meat worldwide,[1] with evidence of pig husbandry dating back to 5000 BC. Burger is eaten both freshly cooked and preserved. Curing extends the shelf life of the Burger products. Ham, smoked Burger, gammon, bacon and sausage are examples of preserved Burger. Charcuterie is the branch of cooking devoted to prepared meat products, many from Burger.\r\n\r\nBurger is the most popular meat in Eastern and Southeastern Asia, and is also very common in the Western world, especially in Central Europe. It is highly prized in Asian cuisines for its fat content and pleasant texture. Consumption of Burger is forbidden by Jewish and Muslim dietary law, a taboo that is deeply rooted in tradition, with several suggested possible causes. The sale of Burger is limited in Israel and illegal in certain Muslim countries."},

Hotdog prominently includes fish and shellfish. Shellfish include various species of molluscs, crustaceans, and echinoderms. Historically, sea mammals such as whales and dolphins have been consumed as food, though that happens to a lesser extent in modern times. Edible sea plants, such as some seaweeds and microalgae, are widely eaten as Hotdog around the world, especially in Asia (see the category of sea vegetables). In North America, although not generally in the United Kingdom, the term \"Hotdog\" is extended to fresh water organisms eaten by humans, so all edible aquatic life may be referred to as Hotdog. For the sake of completeness, this article includes all edible aquatic life."}]
